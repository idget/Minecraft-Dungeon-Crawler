Start turtle on the far right of a dungeon corridor. moves forward unless it sees that the block to the right of it is empty if it is t will turn right. 
if the turtle runs into a block it will turn left.

place a torch every 10

do the same as the above just with a trutle that starts on the left and turns left each time.

haviing two will explore the entire dungeon rathar effeicntly while lighting it up.

turtles inventory will need to by filled with torches and one empty spot. the empty spot will be used for comparing blocks for turns

down falls:

if dungeon ends unexpectidly such as a ravine or cave. 

when sending turtles in it would be best to carry a drive with the program and extra turtles to start exploring extra corridors in case the turtle is lost.
